*****************************************************************************************************************
Also:
I know this is thinking far ahead, but it is best to sort this out now than finding it as we go and having to find a hasty alternative.

We must think about how movement will work. WASD-based, click-and-move, etc.
Whatever chosen will need some form of rotation - you need to get your attacking side facing your prey...
Additionally, the user-chosen placement of flagellum would mean that rotation and movement would be hard to "balance".
